 clientRemarksHeader: in client's words
 clientRemarks: Swati is among one of the best product focussed UX designers I have worked with in my career. She quickly demonstrated that she could solve all our vexing issues related to UX and UI for Cannalign. She has always displayed a high degree of responsibility, client service, creativity, and initiative. Iâ€™m happy with the work Swati did and given the chance, I'd love to work again with her in future.
