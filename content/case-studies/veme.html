 challenge: <p>I have been associated with VEME since its inception in 2016 as part of engineering team at Appinventiv. Originally not aimed for blockchain, the project has gone through various layers of iterations in the past. However with each update, our vision on how this product can cater to solve real world problems got clearer and clearer. </p><p>Cut short to 2018 and I find myself now a part of a global team sitting in Vancouver, India and US working together to bring a shared vision to life. One of the challenges working on this product was collaborating successfully across different time zones from remote locations. I had the chance to collaborate with designers <a href=‘https://www.facebook.com/iriszoskidesign/’>Iris Zoski</a> (onboarded for VEME’s branding) and <a href=‘https://yashparkar.me/’>Yash Parker</a> (onboarded as gamification & behavioral psychology expert) to name a few. </p><p>However the elephant in the room was breaking moulds and bringing together a feature set (scheduled and released in a planned manner) that sets the tone straight for centralised social media apps. This is the approach I adopted to get that elephant out.</p>
