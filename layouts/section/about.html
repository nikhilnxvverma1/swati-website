			Hello. My name is Swati and I work with smart and passionate folks at Appinventiv as Creative Head.
		</h2>
		<p class="sub-text">
			I believe in concept-driven, iterative design work and broadening my horizons. I tend to craft visual communication for brands, people, and discerning systems everywhere. I have ten years of extensive experience in product design, strategy and leadership for cross functional and creative teams.
		</p>
		
		<p class="sub-text">
			Recently I have been fully engaged with corporate branding for <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/74160861/Branding-Indias-Leading-Mobile-App-Development-Company" target="_blank">Appinventiv</a> and leading business analysis and visual communication for <a href="/case-studies/veme/" target="_blank"><span class="themed">VEME</span></a>- the world's first creative platform build on blockchain framework for short form viral videos, that exist to liberate and reward everyone's creative expression.

		<h3 class="uppercase">My design journey</h3>
		<p class="sub-text">I started my career as web designer for a small time IT company based in Noida. Because I wanted to be closer to the product and work in collaboration with product owners and managers, I shifted to a tech start-up called AppStudioz as Sr. Creative Designer. There I build the design team of 30+ creative professionals from grounds up.</p>
		<p class="sub-text">Since last three year, I am happily crafting successful product experiences for Appinventiv, one of India's leading mobile app development company. To know more about my professional journey, download my resume.</p>

		<h3 class="uppercase">Outside Work</h3>
		<p class="sub-text">My passion for design bleeds outside work. In 2015, I participated and won the position of fourth runner up in a country wide appathon called 6E Appsters organised by Indigo Airlines. The competition with more than 1200 submissions aimed to uplift their current version of mobile app and deliver a solution that leads to greater visibility and downloads for the product.</p>

		<p class="sub-text">Other than being a designer, I am a mother to a two years old toddler and an avid MCU fan. When not working, I love spending some quality time with my son, exploring my city or binge watching Netflix on lazy Sunday afternoons.</p>
